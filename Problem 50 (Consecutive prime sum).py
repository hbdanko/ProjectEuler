# The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
# 
# 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
# This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
# 
# The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, 
#Â contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
# 
# Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
