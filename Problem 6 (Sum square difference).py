# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 
# 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + ... + 10 ^ 2 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 
# (1 + 2 + ... + 10) ^ 2 = 55 ^ 2 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# 
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
